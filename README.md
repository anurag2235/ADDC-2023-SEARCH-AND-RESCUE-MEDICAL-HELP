It uses yolo v7 model and count the number of people in the frame and display on the ground station screen.
It is designed to be used in a UAS that is designed to go to a search area on a search and rescue mission to find people in need 
and then it detects the people in need and count the number of people and it displays the data live to the mission centre on the
