### Install all the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Detect the image

```
python image.py
```

### Detect the webcam

```
python webcam.py
```

### Detect the video

```
python video.py
```

### Detect multiple live video streams in parallel

Create a new text file called **streams.txt** inside the repository folder and put the URLs of the streams in each new line, for example:

```
https://192.168.0.203:8080/video
https://192.168.0.204:8080/video
https://192.168.0.205:8080/video
```

Then execute the streams script.

```
python streams.py
```

### Track the video

```
python track_video.py
```

### Track the webcam

```
python track_webcam.py
```

### Detect and OCR the image

```
python ocr_image.py
```

### Detect and OCR the video

This script uses a license plate recognition model (ANPR / ALPR), so you will have to edit it for it to work with your own model by changing the **weights** file, **classes** yaml file and finally the **ocr_classes** list.

```
python ocr_video.py
```

## Train YOLOv7 on your own custom dataset

Watch the following tutorial to learn how to do it.

### Click the weights button

Go to your training experiment and click the weights button on the top right corner.

### Download the files

Download the best or last weights and the classes YAML file and put them inside the repository folder.

### Use your own custom model

Change the following line to use your custom model.

``` Python
yolov7.load('best.weights', classes='classes.yaml', device='cpu') # use 'gpu' for CUDA GPU inference
```
